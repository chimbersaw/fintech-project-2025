# Fintech Project

[https://github.com/chimbersaw/fintech-project-2025](https://github.com/chimbersaw/fintech-project-2025)

There are 3 notebooks in this project (please look at them in order):

- `preprocess.ipynb`: Data analysis and preprocessing.
- `trees.ipynb`: The decision tree/random forest classifiers.
- `nn.ipynb`: The neural network model.

I interpret the results in the `trees.ipynb` notebook.

All the images can be found in good resolution in the `img` folder.
